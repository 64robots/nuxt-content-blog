To get started quickly you can use the [create-nuxt-content-blog](https://github.com/64robots/create-nuxt-content-blog) package.

<code-group>
  <code-block label="Yarn" active>

  ```bash
  yarn create nuxt-content-blog <project-name>
  ```

  </code-block>
  <code-block label="NPX">

  ```bash
  # Make sure you have npx installed (npx is shipped by default since NPM 5.2.0) or npm v6.1 or yarn.
  npx create-nuxt-content-blog <project-name>
  ```

  </code-block>
  <code-block label="NPM">

  ```bash
  # Starting with npm v6.1 you can do:
  npm init nuxt-content-blog <project-name>
  ```

  </code-block>
</code-group>

It will ask few questions about your project and install all the dependencies. The next step is to get into your project folder and launch it:

<code-group>
  <code-block label="Yarn" active>

  ```bash
  cd <project-name>
  yarn dev
  ```

  </code-block>
  <code-block label="NPM">

  ```bash
  cd <project-name>
  npm run dev
  ```

  </code-block>
</code-group>

The application is now running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Well done!
